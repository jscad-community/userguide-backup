===== Conversions =====

==== Conversions between Degrees and Radians ====

Convert the given angle (degrees) to radians.

<code javascript>
let radians = degToRad(90) // PI / 2 radians
</code>

Convert the given angle (radians) to degrees.

<code javascript>
let degrees = radToDeg(Math.PI / 2) // 90 degrees
</code>

==== Conversions of Radius to Segments ====

Calculate the number of segments from the given radius based on minimum length or angle.

There are various round shapes that support the 'segments' option. Often times, a design requires a specific precision for each segment. This function assists by calculating the appropriate number of segments based on radius, as well as minimum length or minimum angle.

<code javascript>
let segments = radiusToSegments(3.5, 0.1, 0) /* use minimum length */
let segments = radiusToSegments(3.5, 0, Math.PI * 2 / 300) /* use minimum angle */
