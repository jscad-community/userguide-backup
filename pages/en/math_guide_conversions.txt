===== Conversions =====

==== Conversions between Degrees and Radians ====

Convert the given angle (degrees) to radians.

<code javascript>
const { degToRad } = require('@jscad/modeling').utils
let radians = degToRad(90) // PI / 2 radians
</code>

Convert the given angle (radians) to degrees.

<code javascript>
const { radToDeg } = require('@jscad/modeling').utils
let degrees = radToDeg(Math.PI / 2) // 90 degrees
</code>

==== Conversions of Radius to Segments ====

Calculate the number of segments to complete the given radius (full rotation), using either minimum length or minimum angle.

There are various round shapes that support the 'segments' option. However, designs may require a specific 'precision' for specific shapes. For example, an arc as part of a path requires specific length segments for proper laser cutting.

This function can be used to calculate the appropriate number of segments based on the radius of the rounded shape.

Using the above example, the arc has a radius of 3.5 mm (units are typically mm). The laser printer requires 0.1 mm segments or more while moving. The segments can be calculated, and supplied when creating the arc.

<code javascript>
const { radiusToSegments } = require('@jscad/modeling').utils

let segments = radiusToSegments(3.5, 0.1, 0) /* use minimum length */
let segments = radiusToSegments(3.5, 0, Math.PI * 2 / 300) /* use minimum angle */ 
</code>

//NOTE: The number of segments can become large depending on the 'precision' requirements. Testing designs with a lower number of segments is recommended.//
