===== 2D Primitives =====

â€˜2Dâ€™ stands for two (2) dimensional. A 2D primitive is any shape that has two dimensions, which are width and length  (or X and Y.) The 2D dimensional shapes have no thickness (Although, JSCAD shows a very thin shape.)

One way of thinking about 2D shapes is anything that lays flat on a piece of paper, such as drawing a circle or a square.

The mathematical study of 2D shapes and dimensions is called [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)|plane geometry]].

=== Resolution of Shapes ===

All rounded shapes have a ''segments'' option which controls tessellation. If ''segments'' is set to 8, then 8 segments are used to create PI * 2 radians of revolution. If the ''segments'' option is omitted, the default value is used.

This allows each design to control the amount of detail present, but beware that calculations and rendering time will also increase. For example, the number of polygons increases quadratically with each increase of the ''segments'' for spheres.
