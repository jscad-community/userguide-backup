==== Linear Extrude ====

{{ :wiki:jscad-extrudelinear.png?nolink | Extrude Linear}}

Extrude a two dimensional shape in an upward linear direction.

The two dimensional shape is extruded to the ''height'', upwards along the Z axis. The two dimensional shape is be rotated ''twistAngle'' about the Z axis during the extrusion, creating ''twistSteps'' during the extrusion.

//Note: The two dimensional shape can be placed anywhere to create various twisted shapes.//

Defaults:
  * height : 1
  * twist : 0
  * twistSteps : 1 

<code javascript>
const myshape = extrudeLinear({height: radiusZ * 2}, shape1)
const myshape = extrudeLinear({height: radiusZ * 2, twistAngle: Math.PI / 2, twistSteps: 10}, shape2)
