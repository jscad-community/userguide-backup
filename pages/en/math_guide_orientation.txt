===== Orientation =====

All the internal calculations of JSCAD (and other included libraries) are based on the 'right-hand' rule. (For more information see discussions [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule|here]] and [[https://www.pasco.com/products/guides/right-hand-rule|here]].)

This results in the following orientation of the three-dimensional coordinate system, i.e. orientation of X, Y, and Z axis.
  * Positive X points to the right
  * Positive Y points to the back
  * Positive Z points to the top

This also means that positive rotations are
  * From positive X to positive Y about the Z axis
  * From positive Y to positive Z about the X axis
  * From positive Z to positive X about the Y axis

It may take some time to understand well, and can be visualized by rotating shapes by both positive and negative angles.
