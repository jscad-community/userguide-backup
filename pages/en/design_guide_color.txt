==== Color ====

Shapes can exhibit different colors. And just like the other transformations, adding color to a shape produces a new shape, i.e. one with color.

Colors are not only important for visual rendering but also controlling the selection of filaments during 3D printing. Therefore, colors should be applied as the last step in designs to insure proper printing.

<code javascript>
const myshape = colorize([1, 0, 0], sphere()) // RGB red
const myshape = colorize([1, 0.5, 0.3], sphere()) // color
const myshape = colorize([1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.6], sphere()) // color plus alpha transparency
</code>

//Note: There are known issues with transparency, and depending on the order of colors, objects may not seem transparent. Try different 'alpha' values or colors.//

=== Color Space Conversion ===

There are several functions to convert between color spaces, including color names.

<code javascript>
const wildcylinder = colorize(colorNameToRgb('fuchsia'), cylinder())

const bluesphere = colorize(hexToRgb('#000080'), sphere()) // navy blue

const mysphere = colorize(hslToRgb([0.9166666666666666, 1, 0.5]), sphere())

const mysphere = colorize(hsvToRgb([0.9166666666666666, 1, 1]), sphere())
</code>
