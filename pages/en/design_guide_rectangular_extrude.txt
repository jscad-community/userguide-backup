==== Rectangular Extrude ====

{{ :wiki:jscad-extruderectangular.png?nolink | Extrude Rectangular}}

Extrude a rectangle (upright, perpendicular) along the outlines of the two dimensional shape.

The two dimensional shape is extruded to the ''height'', upwards along the Z axis.

//Note: The extrusion process uses Linear Extrude underneath, so the extrusion can be rotated ''twistAngle'' about the Z axis during the extrusion, creating ''twistSteps'' during the extrusion.//

Defaults:
  * size: 1 (width of rectangle during extrusion)
  * height : 1

<code javascript>
const myshape = extrudeRectangular({height: radiusZ * 2, size: 0.25}, shape1)
const myshape = extrudeRectangular({height: radiusZ * 2, size: 3, twistAngle: Math.PI / 2, twistSteps: 10}, shape2)
