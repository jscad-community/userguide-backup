Sometimes complex shapes need to be divided into the smaller pieces. A good example is when creating 'molds' from the pieces of a boolean operation. Or splitting a complex shape into the component pieces from an imported design, i.e. splitting STL models.

<code javascript>
const newshapes = scission(bigshape) // expect an array containing the pieces
