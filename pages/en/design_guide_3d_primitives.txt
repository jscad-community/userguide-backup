===== 3D Primitives =====

‘3D’ stands for three (3) dimensional. A 3D primitive is any shape that has three dimensions, which are often called width, depth, and height (or X, Y, Z.) 3D shapes have a known volume if closed.

The mathematical study of 3D shapes and dimensions is called [[https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry|solid geometry]].

==== Resolution of Shapes ====

All rounded shapes have a ''segments'' option which controls tesselation. If ''segments'' is set to 8, then 8 polygons are used to create a full revolution. If the ''segments'' option is omitted, the default value is used.

This allows each design to control the amount of detail present, but beware that calculations and rendering time will also increase. For example, the number of polygons increases quadratically with each increase of the ''segments'' for spheres.

Sometimes, a design requires a certain degree of resolution which is expressed in the length between points, or the angle between points. If this is the case, then use the conversion function to calculate the require segments. See [[math_guide_conversions|Conversions]]
