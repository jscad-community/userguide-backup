==== Scale ====

Shapes can be scaled by any factor, enlarging (increasing) or shrinking (diminishing) shapes by the ''factors'' about X, Y, and Z axis. The result of scaling is a similar shape (in the geometric sense) to the original.

//[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry)|Learn about the scaling shapes at Wikipedia.org]]//

Defaults:
  * factors : [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

<code javascript>
const myshape = sphere({radius: 5})
const newshape = scale([2, 4, 6], myshape)
</code>

In addition, there are simple versions of the same function for scaling about a single axis.

<code javascript>
const myshape = sphere({radius: 5})
let newshape = scaleX(2, myshape)
newshape = scaleY(4, newshape)
newshape = scaleZ(6, newshape)
</code>
