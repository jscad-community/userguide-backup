==== Translate ====

Shapes can be translated (moved) to another location. In other words, every point in the shape is moved by a fixed distance as given by the ''offset''. The ''offset'' can be positive or negative.

//[[http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/translation.html|Learn about translation at MathIsFun.com]]//

Defaults:
  * offset : [0, 0, 0]

<code javascript>
const myshape = sphere([radius: 5})
const newshape = translate([3, 7, -10], myshape)
</code>

In addition, there are simple versions of the same function for translating about a single axis.

<code javascript>
const myshape = sphere([radius: 5})
let newshape = translateX(3, myshape)
newshape = translateY(7, newshape)
newshape = translateZ(-10, newshape)
</code>
