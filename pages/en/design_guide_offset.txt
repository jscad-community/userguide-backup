{{ :wiki:jscad-offset.png?nolink | Offset}}

//Note: The original shape is black.//

Offsetting two or three dimensional shapes can be performed, which maintains a specific ''delta'' distance from the shape. The ''corners'' can be filled with 'edge', 'round", or 'chamfer' edges.

The opposite is also possible by specifying a negative (-) ''delta''.

Defaults:
  * delta : 1
  * corners : 'edge'
  * segments : 16

<code javascript>
const myshape = offset({corners: 'round'}, shape1)
const myshape = offset({delta: -2}, shape2)
const myshape = offset({delta: 2}, shape3)
</code>

//Note: Offsetting three dimensional shapes NOT possible today. This is a known issue.//
