{{ :wiki:jscad-union.png?nolink | Union}}

Several shapes can be combined (merged) into a single shape, creating complex 'parts'. The combining of smaller obects together allows the 'part' to be used in other operations, transformations, etc.

<code javascript>
const newshape = union(cube({size: 10}), cylinder({radius: 4, heigth: 14})
