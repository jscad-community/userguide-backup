NOTE: The ordering of points is VERY IMPORTANT. If this polygon is going to be extruded, the points must be in counter-clockwise order. Otherwise the faces of the object will be facing inwards.

The following show examples of creating polygons from a list of points.

Defaults:
  * empty

<code javascript>
const myshape = polygon({ points: [ [0,0],[3,0],[3,3] ] })
